## Will I Ever Know it All?

![[xkcd : Git](https://xkcd.com/1597/)](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/git.png){alt="XKCD Git Cartoon : This is Git. It tracks collaborative work on projects through a beautiful distributed graph theory tree model. Cool. How Do we use it? No idea. Just memorise these shell commands and type them to sync up. If you get errors, save your work elsewhere, delete the project and download a fresh copy."}

Probably not. There is simply too much to Git and associated tools like GitHub/GitLab and Pre-Commit to have any hope of
knowing everything there is to about all aspects. That shouldn't dishearten you from learning what you need to as you
go.

## How can I keep on learning more about Git?

Practise makes perfect, or so the saying goes, but in the case of computing its true, if you don't practise using
the tools or writing code you will not improve. Whilst you might not reach perfection you will become more proficient.

## What material would you recommend?

This course is the result of the author(s) learning path which was not undertaken in isolation but a consequence of
years of usage and a lot of reading.  Below there are links to a number of references, blogs, videos and so forth for
finding out more about Git, GitHub and so forth.

### References

- [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) a comprehensive book about Git, very, very detailed.
- [Learn Git - Tutorials, Workflows and Commands | Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/git) excellent resources from
  Atlassian their tutorials are clear and informative and inspired much of this course.

### Videos

- [So You Think You Know Git - Scott Chacon FOSDEM 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aolI_Rz0ZqY) an excellent talk
  by one of the co-founders of GitHub.
- [So You Think You Konw Git (Part 2) - Scott Chacon DevWorld 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md44rcw13k4) another
  excellent talk.

### Blogs

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout

### RSS

[Really Simply Syndication](https://rssboard.org/rss-specification) is a much under appreciated/used technology that
makes it really simple to syndicate blog posts from a range of sources to give yourself a customised reading list rather
than being at the whim of whatever is in your social media feeds when you happen to take a look at them.

Many of the blogs linked above have RSS feeds and whilst not all posts will be focused on Git you can sometimes get
specific feeds for topics. I would highly recommend using [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) reader not just for
improving your understanding of Git but all other research areas (e.g. Python, R, Open Research et.c) Some useful
resources for RSS feeds are below.

- [OpenRSS](https://openrss.org/) is a simple way of creating RSS feeds for sites, even if they don't natively provided
  them.
- [Feeder](https://github.com/spacecowboy/Feeder) open source, private feed reader that runs on your Android device.
- [Feedly](https://feedly.com/) web-based feed aggregator.
- [FreshRSS](https://www.freshrss.org/) a free, self-hostable feeds aggregator if you run your own websites.
- [Tiny Tiny RSS](https://tt-rss.org/) another free, self-hostable feeds aggregator if you run your own websites.

### Mastodon

There are a lot of technical users who post their articles, ask questions and help each other out about all sorts
of languages and tools on Mastodon. Join an instance and follow `#git` to keep abreast of things and find out what
others struggle with and how they can be solved.

[Fedi.Tips](https://fedi.tips/) is a useful guide to getting started with Mastodon and once you're setup it can be
useful to use the [Advanced Web
Interface](https://fedi.tips/how-to-activate-mastodons-tweetdeck-style-advanced-web-interface/) and add a column for the
`#git` tag. A good Android client is [Fedilab](https://fedilab.app/).
