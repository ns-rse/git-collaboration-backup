::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Git Configuration

Git configuration comes in two forms, "global" and "local" and is courtesy of some simple text files. The global
configuration file lives in your home directory and on GNU/Linux and OSX systems is `~/.gitconfig` (on Windows it is
`C:\Users\<username>\.gitconfig`) and will have been setup when you first attempted to use Git and were prompted for
your name and email address.

Each repository that is under Git version control has a `.git/` directory where all of the configuration, hooks and
history live. Within this directory you will find a `.git/config` file which is the "local" configuration for that
repository. Configuration options defined locally over-ride global configuration options.

There are two ways of modifying either the global or local configuration, using the Command Line `git config <options>`
or by editing either the global (`~/.gitconfig`) or local (`git/config`) files.

### `git config`

The `git config` command has a host of options that you can view with the `--help` flag. The first required option says
what file should be modified and is typically either `global` or `local`. You can view the configuration with `git
config --list` and you can optional restrict it to either the `--global` or `--local` configuration.

``` bash
git config --list
git config --list --local
git config --list --global
```

Adding values requires a bit of understanding about the structure of the configuration file, a very simple example is
shown below.

``` bash
[user]
 email = a.n.other@sheffield.ac.uk
 name = A N Other
[core]
 editor = nano
 sshCommand = ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 -F /dev/null
 attributesFile = $HOME/.gitattributes
 autocrlf = input
 excludesfile = ~/dotfiles/git/.gitignore
```

Sections are in square brackets with names, e.g. `[user]` or `[core]`. Fields then have key and value pairs e.g. the
`name` value is set to `A N Other` the `email` address is `a.n.other@sheffield.ac.uk` and the `editor` is set to `nano`
and so forth.

To modify values you need to know the section and the key you want to change, these are combined to give the third
argument `user.email` and you then provide the value you want it to be as the fourth argument. For example to change the
email address in the global configuration you would.

``` bash
git config --global user.email a.other@sheffield.ac.uk
```

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout

You can always lookup the location of configuration options using the following command which shows the file in which each
configuration is set as the first column of output.

``` bash
git config --list --show-origin --show-scope

```

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Editing config files

You can also edit both the local (`.git/config`) and global (`~/.gitconfig`) files directly to set configuration options
and this can at times be much quicker.

For example if we wanted to configure Git so that the order in which branches are listed is by the most recent commit we
could add the following to our `~/.gitconfig` using `nano`, which will result in branches being listed in reverse
chronological order when you `git branch --list`.

``` bash
[branch]
    sort = -commiterdate
```

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

## Challenge 1

Add the fields `user` and `email` to the `github` section of your global configuration setting them to your GitHub
username and your registered email address.

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

## Solution 1 - Command Line

``` bash
git config --global github.user ns-rse
git config --global github.email n.shephard@sheffield.ac.uk
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

## Solution 2 - Editing `~/.gitconfig`

You could alternatively edit the `~/.gitconfig` file directly and add the following lines

``` bash
[github]
    user = ns-rse
    email = n.shephard@sheffield.ac.uk
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Alias'

A very useful configuration option available is the ability to set [aliases][gitaliases] for Git. This means you can
create short cuts to complex commands. Aliases live under the `[alias]` section of the global (`.gitconfig`) or local
(`.git/config`) configuration files. They can be set at the command line with `git config --[global|local]
alias.<shortcut> <command>` .

If you wanted to save a few key strokes and set `sw` as an alias for `switch` globally you would.

``` bash
git config --global alias.sw switch
```

Or if you want to unstage files that are currently staged you can set an `unstage` alias using the following where the
command you wish to add is put in quotes so the shell doesn't think they are arguments to the command and treats them as
a string.

As with other configuration options you can also edit the configuration files directly to add the commands.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

## Challenge 2 - Set a &nbsp; `git log` alias

`git log` shows the history of commits on the current branch, but its default is quite verbose. Fortunately there are a
_lot_ of options to modify the output adding colour, shortening dates and including a graph. You can see all the options
in the manual ([`git log --help`][gitlog]). For this exercise add the following set of log options to an alias of your
choice (this course uses `logp` but you are free to set it to whatever you want, e.g. `lp`)

``` bash
log --pretty=format:"%C(yellow)%h\\ %C(green)%ad%Cred%d\\ %Creset%s%Cblue\\ [%cn]" --decorate --date=short --graph
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

## Solution 1 - Edit &nbsp; `~/.gitconfig`

You can set the alias `logp` to the above `git log` options by editing `~/.gitconfig` and adding the following

``` bash
[alias]
    logp = log --pretty=format:"%C(yellow)%h\\ %C(green)%ad%Cred%d\\ %Creset%s%Cblue\\ [%cn]" --decorate --date=short --graph
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

## Solution 2 - Use &nbsp; `git config`

You could also set this alias at the command line

``` bash
git config --global alias.logp 'log --pretty=format:"%C(yellow)%h\\ %C(green)%ad%Cred%d\\ %Creset%s%Cblue\\ [%cn]" --decorate --date=short --graph'
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### `.gitignore`

The [`.gitignore`][gitignore] file does exactly what you might expect it to, it contains lists of directories and files
that should be ignored. To save having to write out the path to each and every file the format accepts
[patterns][gitignorepatterns]. This file, like many others uses `#` as a comment, to use a `#` in a file name you
therefore need to escape it with the `\` slash. A `*` matches anything but slashes and leading/trailing `**` match
all directories (leading) or everything within a directory (trailing). For more details

A common set of files you may want to ignore is the `.DS_Store` directory that Mac OSX automatically generates in
most directories. Just as you can exclude files you can list directories so add that to the `.gitignore` in the
`python-maths` repository now. Navigate to the directory and open the file using [nano][nano] and add the following
line.

``` bash
.DS_Store
```

It is often sensible to ensure data files are not included in your repository. What these files might be depends on how
you are working, common formats are `.csv` for text files `.RData` for files from [R][r] and `.pkl` are the Python
pickles.

GitHub has a useful feature when you create a repository to include template `.gitignore` files for specific languages,
but if you missed out this step you can always use the [.gitignore generator][ignoregenerator] to generate files to be
ignored and copy and paste these in.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor

Remember to switch to GitHub and go through the process of creating a new repository to show where the option to select
a template can be found.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The `.gitignore` file is part of the repository and is itself version controlled, this means that its rules are applied
consistently across anyone who works on the project or a fork of it (since forks may end up making contributions
up-stream). You therefore have to remember to stage and commit changes to the file just as you would other files in the
repository.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

## Challenge 3

In your pairs exclude files with the extension `.csv` and `.pkl` from being added to the `python-maths` project by
adding the appropriate pattern to the `.gitignore` file on a new branch and merge it into the `main` branch via a
pull-request, assigning it to the other person for review.

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

## Update the `.gitignore`

The following lines to `.gitignore` will ignore all files with the extensions `.csv` and `.pkl`. The wildcard symbol `*`
is required to ensure _any_ file, no matter what comes before the extension is ignored.

```output
*.csv
*.pkl
```

Staging and committing, then pushing to GitHub

``` bash
git switch main
git pull
git switch -c ns-rse/ignore-csv-pkl
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "chore: Ignoring .csv and .pkl files"
git push
```

Pull requests are created on GitHub.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### `difftastic`

When undertaking Pull Requests on GitHub there is the ability to toggle between two [different views][githubdiff] of the
differences. The standard view shows the changes line-by-line and looks like the following where the deleted lines are
started with `-` signs and may well be in red and the added lines are started with `+` and may well be in green. Changes
within a line are reflected as a deletion _and_ addition.

``` bash

Its a matter of personal preference but it can sometimes be easier to look at differences in the split view that
`difftastic` provides, the same changes above using the split view are shown below.

Show how to toggle the view on GitHub pull requests. Make sure to have an example that is already open in a tab of your
browser.

If you have `difftastic` already configured for Git make sure to disable if you are going to show the difference in the
terminal live.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

## Challenge 4

Install [difftastic][difftastic] on your computer and configure Git globally to use it.

**Hint** There are instructions on the [website][difftastic].

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

## Update the `~/.gitconfig`

The [instructions](https://difftastic.wilfred.me.uk/git.html) show the configuration options you can add to
`~/.gitconfig` to setup an alias for `git dft` which uses `difftastic`. The following in your `.gitconfig` will set that
up.

```config
[diff]
        tool = difftastic

[difftool]
        prompt = false

[difftool "difftastic"]
        cmd = difft "$LOCAL" "$REMOTE"

[pager]
        difftool = true
# `git dft` is less to type than `git difftool`.
[alias]
        dft = difftool
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Atomic Commits

The idea of atomic commits is that they are small self-contained commits focused on one issue, all the changes are
typically in a small subset of files, e.g. only the a particular module and its associated test file. But you may have
learnt to make lots of small commits frequently and so you're history may look like.

``` bash
git log --oneline
  0d2f520 Correct spelling
  325d038 Document function xyz
  86d7633 Add docstring to function xyz
  a58d6e7 Fix function xyz to pass tests
  9429ab4 Add test for function xyz
  bb560b0 Add function xyz
```

Here six commits have been made for adding the `xyz` function, writing tests that pass, adding docstrings to the
function and correcting some spelling mistakes. But all of these pertain to one issue that will have been written up on
the projects issues and as the work is self-contained and we've not added to any other files they could be a single
commit.

Git has a few functions to help here and we'll go through those.

We'll use the `python-maths` repository as an example and will make a new branch to add a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file to.

``` bash
cd pytest-maths
git switch -c amend-fixup-tutorial
  Switched to a new branch 'amend-fixup-tutorial'
```

We now add a simple `CONTRIBUTING.md` file to the repository.

``` bash
echo "# Contributing\n\nContributions via pull requests are welcome." > CONTRIBUTING.md
git add CONTRIBUTING.md
git commit -m "docs: Adding CONTRIBUTING.md"
```

``` bash
git logp
  01191a2 (HEAD -> amend-fixup-tutorial) Adding CONTRIBUTING.md
```

### Making Amends

Sometimes you will have made a commit and you realise that you want to add more to it or perhaps you forgot to run your
test suite and find that on running it your tests fail so you need to make a correction. In this example we want to be
more explicit about how to make contributions and let people know they should fork the branch.

``` bash
echo "\nPlease make a fork of this repository, make your changes and open a Pull Request." >> CONTRIBUTING.md
```

Now you could make a second commit...

``` bash
git add -u && git commit -m "docs: Ask for PRs via fork in CONTRIBUTING.md"
```

``` bash
git logp
9f0655b (HEAD -> amend-fixup-tutorial) Ask for PRs via fork in CONTRIBUTING.md
01191a2 Adding CONTRIBUTING.md
```

...and there is nothing wrong with that. However, Git history can get long and complicated when there are lots of small
commits, because these two changes to `CONTRIBUTING.md` are essentially the same piece of work then If we'd been
thinking clearly we would have written about making forks in the first place and made a single commit.

Fortunately Git can help here as there is the `git commit --amend` option which adds the staged changes to the last
commit and allows you to edit the last commit message (if nothing is currently staged then you will be prompted to edit
the last commit message). We can undo the last commit using `git reset HEAD~1` (more on resetting later) and instead
amend the first commit that added the `CONTRIBUTING.md`

``` bash
git reset HEAD~1
git add -u
git commit --amend
```

``` bash
git logp
  4fda15f (HEAD -> amend-fixup-tutorial) Adding CONTRIBUTING.md
cat CONTRIBUTING.md
# Contributing

Contributions via pull requests are welcome.

Please make a fork of this repository, make your changes and open a Pull Request.
```

We now have one commit which contains the new `CONTRIBUTING.md` file with all the changes we wished to have in the file
in the first place and our Git history is slightly more compact.

### `git commit --fixup`

Amending commits is great providing the commit you want to change is the last commit you made (i.e. `HEAD`). But
sometimes you might wish to correct a commit further back in your history and `git commit --amend` is of no use
here. Git has a solution though in the form of `git commit --fixup` command which allows you to mark a commit as being a
"fix up" of an older commit. These can then be autosquashed via an interactive Git rebase.

Let's add a few empty commits to our `amend-fixup-tutorial` branch to so we can do this.

``` bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "Empty commit for demonstration purposes"
git commit --allow-empty -m "Another empty commit for demonstration purposes"
```

```bash
git logp
  8061221 (HEAD -> amend-fixup-tutorial) Another empty commit for demonstration purposes
  65587ce Empty commit for demonstration purposes
  4fda15f Adding CONTRIBUTING.md
  35aa48c Previous commit before adding CONTRIBUTING.md
```

And let's expand our `CONTRIBUTING.md` file further.

``` bash
echo "\nPlease note this repository uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) to lint the Python code and Markdown files." >> CONTRIBUTING.md
```

We want to merge this commit with the first one we made in this tutorial using `git commit --fixup`. To do this we need
to know the hash (`4fda15f` see output from above `git logp`). You then use `git commit --fixup <hash>` to commit your
changes as a "fixup" of the earlier commit.

``` bash
git add -u
git commit --fixup 4fda15f
```

We see the commit we have just made starts with `fixup!` and is then followed by the commit message that it is fixing,
but it hasn't yet been combined into that commit.

```bash
git log --oneline
  97711a4 (HEAD -> amend-fixup-tutorial) fixup! Adding CONTRIBUTING.md
  8061221 Another empty commit for demonstration purposes
  65587ce Empty commit for demonstration purposes
  4fda15f Adding CONTRIBUTING.md
  35aa48c Previous commit before adding CONTRIBUTING.md
```

The final step is to perform the automatic squashing via an interactive rebase. You need to supply the hash of the
commit _before_ the one you are fixing up, in this case `35aa48c` (check the output of `git logp` if you haven't made a
note of this).

``` bash
git rebase -i --autosquash 4fda15f
```

This will open the default editor and because the `--autosquash` option has been used it should have marked the
commits that need combining with `fixup`. All you have to do is save the file and exit and we can check the history and
look at the contents of the file.

**NB** If you find that the necessary commit _isn't_ already marked navigate then you are likely to have supplied the
wrong hash (most probably the hash of the commit your wish to fixup rather than the commit before it).

```bash
git logp
  0fda21e (HEAD -> amend-fixup-tutorial) Another empty commit for demonstration purposes
  65587ce Empty commit for demonstration purposes
  4fda15f Adding CONTRIBUTING.md
  35aa48c Previous commit before adding CONTRIBUTING.md

cat CONTRIBUTING.md
  # Contributing

  Contributions via pull requests are welcome.

  Please make a fork of this repository, make your changes and open a Pull Request.

  Please note this repository uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) to lint the Python code and Markdown files.
```

And you're all done! If you were doing this for real on a repository you would now `git push` or continue your work. As
this was just an example we can switch branches back to `main` and force deletion of the branch we created.

``` bash
git switch main
git branch -D amend-fixup-tutorial
```

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

## Challenge 4

In your pairs there are two issue templates in the `python-math` repository that you are using.

- _03 Zero Division Amend and Fixup_
- _04 Square Root Amend and Fixup_

Create and assign one of these each and work through the stages. The tasks build on material already covered
e.g. creating and switching branches and conventions for naming branches and rebasing. Solutions to each step are
provided but try not to use them instead you can use your `history` to check what commands you have used.

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

## Main branch with improved docstrings

The instructions should have guided you through.

On the `main` branch of your `python-maths` repository the `divide` function in `pythonmaths/arithmetic.py` should look
like the following with four examples.

```python
def divide(x: int | float, y: int | float) -> float:
    """
    Divide x by y.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : int | float
        Numerator for division.
    y : int | float
        Denominator for division.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        The result of dividing `x` by `y`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from python_math import arithmetic
    >>> arithmetic.divide(10, 2)
        5.0
    >>> arithmetic.divide(5, 2)
        2.5
    >>> arithmetic.divide(3, 0)
        You can not divide by 0, please choose another value for 'y'.
    >>> arithmetic.divide(1, 0.1)
        10
    """
    return x / y

```

The `square_root` function should look like the following.

``` python
def square_root(x):
    """Return the square root of a number.

    Parameters
    ==========
    x : int | float
        The number for which you wish to find the square root.

    Returns
    =======
    float
        The square root of x.

    Examples
    ========
    >>> from python_math import arithmetic
    >>> arithmetic.square_root(4)
        2.0
    >>> arithmetic.square_root(169)
        13.0
    """
    if x < 0:
        print("WARNING : you have supplied a negative number, the square root is complex.")
    return (x) ** (1 / 2)

```

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### `git absorb`

Rather than having to look up commit hashes or work out how many commits back you need to go to pass as an argument to
`--fixup` you can instead use the [git-absorb][gitabsorb] extension that works out what commits changes to each file
being fixed up need rebasing and with the `--and-rebase` flag it will automatically perform the squashing rebase.

The steps involved then become much shorter with.

```bash
git add -u
git absorb --and-rebase
```

By default `git absorb` will search the last 10 commits but this can be configured at runtime using the `--base` flag to
specify the last commit to check or by adapting the configuration file.

### Squashing commits

If you don't want to use [git-absorb][gitabsorb] and you forgot to use `git commit --fixup` you can still combine
commits using an interactive rebase `git rebase -i`.  We've already touched on `git rebase` in the context of keeping
branches up-to-date but its a very flexible and powerful component of Git and it also allows you to "squash" commits on
the same branch.

We will now make a few commits to our branch and then squash them via an interactive rebase. This helps keep commits
that you will merge into `main` atomic since even if you've been using `git commit --amend` to sequentially update a
commit you may still have several commits on a branch which can be combined into a single informative commit that is
ready for merging into the `main` branch.

Returning to the `python-maths` repository we will make a series of empty commits on a new branch and then undertake an
interactive rebase to squash them.

``` bash
git switch -c test-rebase
git commit --allow-empty -m "Commit 1"
git commit --allow-empty -m "Commit 2"
git commit --allow-empty -m "Commit 3"
git commit --allow-empty -m "Commit 4"
git commit --allow-empty -m "Commit 5"
git logp
```

To squash these commits we need to know the hash or relative reference to the first commit we wish to interact with
which the `git log` command does (if you set the `gl` alias earlier you can use that)

``` bash
git logp
c33ab51 (HEAD -> test-rebase) Commit 5
f7bb1c9 Commit 4
d47d914 Commit 3
e859738 Commit 2
c437414 Commit 1
2f7c382 (origin/main) Merge pull request #6 from ns-rse/ns-rse/tidy-print
a1101c7 [pre-commit.ci] Fixing issues with pre-commit
```

The hash of the first commit we want to squash is `c437414` or `HEAD~5`) but you need to include it. We start a rebase with `git rebase -i c437414` which will open our default editor.

``` bash
pick c437414 Commit 1 # empty
pick e859738 Commit 2 # empty
pick d47d914 Commit 3 # empty
pick f7bb1c9 Commit 4 # empty
pick c33ab51 Commit 5 # empty

# Rebase c437414..c33ab51 onto c437414 (4 commands)
#
# Commands:
# p, pick <commit> = use commit
# r, reword <commit> = use commit, but edit the commit message
# e, edit <commit> = use commit, but stop for amending
# s, squash <commit> = use commit, but meld into previous commit
# f, fixup [-C | -c] <commit> = like "squash" but keep only the previous
#                    commit's log message, unless -C is used, in which case
#                    keep only this commit's message; -c is same as -C but
#                    opens the editor
# x, exec <command> = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
# b, break = stop here (continue rebase later with 'git rebase --continue')
# d, drop <commit> = remove commit
# l, label <label> = label current HEAD with a name
# t, reset <label> = reset HEAD to a label
# m, merge [-C <commit> | -c <commit>] <label> [# <oneline>]
#         create a merge commit using the original merge commit's
#         message (or the oneline, if no original merge commit was
#         specified); use -c <commit> to reword the commit message
# u, update-ref <ref> = track a placeholder for the <ref> to be updated
#                       to this position in the new commits. The <ref> is
#                       updated at the end of the rebase
#
# These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.
#
# If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.
#
# However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.
#
```

The instructions here are really useful and tell us how to edit the rebase. The first line tells us that we are rebasing
the range of commits `onto c437414`. Subsequently there is a list of commands, by default `pick` is in place for each of
the commits, but we are shown the available options and simply need to replace each of the `pick` with `s` or `squash`
and we want to apply it to commits two through to 5.

You can do this manually by editing the file or you can use your editors find and replace functionality which in `nano`
is `Ctrl + \` and you will be prompted for the string you want to find (`pick`) and what you want to replace it with
`squash` and then asked if you want to change the first instance or all. We can safely change all as it doesn't matter
if the instances in the comments section are replaced. The first four rows of the file should now read like the
following.

``` bash
pick   c437414 Commit 1 # empty
squash e859738 Commit 2 # empty
squash d47d914 Commit 3 # empty
squash f7bb1c9 Commit 4 # empty
squash c33ab51 Commit 5 # empty
```

Save this file and exit (in `nano` use `Ctrl + o` then `Ctrl + x`), the editor will exit return you to the prompt and
then in the blink of an eye open the editor again with a different message. This is now your opportunity to edit the
commit message for the single commit that will remain in the tree, as the notes show. Any lines starting with a `#` are
comments and will be ignored but this is very useful as it saves you having to re-write all the text across the commits
and you can instead edit them.

``` bash
# This is a combination of 5 commits.
# This is the 1st commit message:

Commit 1

# This is the commit message #2:

Commit 2

# This is the commit message #3:

Commit 3

# This is the commit message #4:

Commit 4

# This is the commit message #5:

Commit 5

# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
#
# Date:      Fri Mar 8 14:39:47 2024 +0000
#
# interactive rebase in progress; onto 2f7c382
# Last commands done (5 commands done):
#    squash f7bb1c9 Commit 4 # empty
#    squash c33ab51 Commit 5 # empty
# No commands remaining.
# You are currently rebasing branch 'main' on '2f7c382'.
#
# No changes
```

Edit the file to read how you want it to, here I've gone with the following to make it clearly

``` bash
Squash of empty commits 1-5

This is an example of how to squash commits and combines the original commits...

+ Commit 1
+ Commit 2
+ Commit 3
+ Commit 4
+ Commit 5
```

When done save and exit (in `nano` use `Ctrl + O` then `Ctrl + X`). You should be informed the rebase was successful and
if you look at the plain `git log` your commit message will be there at the top in all its glory.

``` bash
git rebase -i 2f7c382
[detached HEAD 2a0c155] Squash of empty commits 1-5
 Date: Fri Mar 8 14:39:47 2024 +0000

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout

When squashing commits they do not have to be contiguous, you can pick and choose any combination. Commits that are
prefixed with `pick` will remain in the Git history.

### Re-writing History - With Great Power

...comes great scope for messing things up!

The `--amend`, `--fixup` and `rebase -i` commands we have worked through are powerful tools, in effect they are
re-writing the Git history that is shown in the `git log`. You may have noticed that the commit hashes change when using
these commands.

If you have pushed your work to GitHub and then use any of these commands to change the history of your branch locally
the two will differ and Git will complain and tell you that you need to `git pull` first. If you know you want to push
the changes you can force them to be pushed using `git push --force-with-lease`, however you should be _very_ careful
doing so in some situations.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout

If anyone else has `git pull` the branch or if the changes have been merged into `main` (or another branch) using these
commands then `git push --force` will cause a lot of headaches so make sure no one else is working on your branches and
don't force push to branches that have already been merged.

`--force-with-lease` offers some protection against the problems that can arise and `--force-if-includes` help catch if
you haven't `git pull` any changes that may be on the `origin`.

The following resources are highly recommended reading on this topic.

## Keep things tidy

Overtime the information about branches and commits can become bloated. We've seen how to delete branches already but
there are a few other simple steps we can take to help keep the repository clean.

### Maintenance

[`git maintenance`][gitmaintenance] is a _really_ useful command that will "_Run tasks to optimize Git repository data,
speeding up other Git commands and reducing storage requirements for the repository._". The details of what this does
are beyond the scope of this tutorial (refer to the [help page][gitmaintenance] if interested). Providing you have setup
your GitHub account with SSH keys and they are available via something such as keychain locally then you can bring a
repository under `git maintenance` and forget about it.

``` bash
git mainetenance register
```

This adds entries to your global configuration (`~/.gitconfig`) to ensure the repository will have these tasks run at
the scheduled point (default is hourly).

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor

Be prepared to explain how SSH keys can be unlocked on login so that the passwords don't need entering every time you
try to use the SSH key.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Conventional Commits

You may have noticed in many of the commit messages used so far a keyword is used to start the commit followed by a
colon. This is an example of [Conventional Commits][concommit] which are a standardised way of writing commit messages
that, as with the branch naming convention suggested earlier, include metadata about what the commit relates to.

There are keywords to start your commit message with that are self-explanatory

- `fix:`
- `feat:` - short for _future_
- `build:`
- `chore:`
- `ci:`
- `docs:`
- `style:`
- `refactor:`
- `perf:` - short for _performance_
- `test:`

If changes relate to a specific component or "scope" of a repository that can be included in parentheses afterwards. For
example the Zero Division issue in `python-maths` relates to the `artihmatic` module so might be started with
`fix(arithmetic)`.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- Global configuration is via `.gitconfig`
- Local configuration is via `.git/config` and takes precedence over Global.
- Configuration can be done at the command line or by editing files.
- Ignore files using `.gitignore`.
- Make commits atomic, i.e. small and focused using `git commit --amend` and `git commit --fixup`, better still make
  life easier using `git absorb`.
- `git rebase --interactive` can be used to squash commits.
- Keeping the commit history atomic and clean makes it easier to understand what work has been undertaken.
- Git periodically tidies things up for you with `git gc`.
- You can and should enable further automated cleaning by enabling `git mainenance` on a repository.
