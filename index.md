# Git Collaboration

Welcome to the _Git Collaboration_ course material.

This course aims to help you develop a deeper understanding of how Git works to facilitate collaboration. It builds on
foundational Git courses such as [Software Carpentry: Git Novice][swCarpentryGit] and [Git and GitHub through
GitKraken : From Zero to Hero!][zeroHero].

The core idea around the course is that by improving your understanding of working with branches and how to make your
commits tidier and neater it makes it easier to understand pull requests and Git history which in turn makes it easier
to collaborate and work on code with others (including your future self!).

The course is and is structured in two halves. The first solidifies the concepts around branches, how to use Git in a
structured manner, termed "git hygiene", and how to use Git hooks effectively to make sure your work is "clean" which
increases your productivity and reduces some of the friction that can arise when working collaboratively. These concepts
serve as a basis for the second half of the course which covers Continuous Integration, effective reviewing and project
management.
