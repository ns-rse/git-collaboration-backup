:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions

- How can I use GitHub/GitLab tools to manage my project?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Be aware of GitHub and GitLab project management tools and their basic functionality.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## GitHub

GitHub has a host of features for managing issues and pull requests. A lot of the functionality and features derive from
the [Agile Framework][agile] for software development which we don't cover in detail in this course but mention in
passing for those who are already familiar with the ideas.

### Projects

### Value and Effort

Value is how much value a particular feature will add to users once implemented.

Effort is how much time it is likely to take to implement the feature.

Together these can help implement.

### Kanban Boards

[Kanban][kanban] is one of several different implementations of [Agile][agile] and one of the key features is the use of
[Kanban Boards][kanban_boards] to organise issues and track their progress from _ToDo_ > _In Progress_ > _Done_.

## GitLab

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- Use `.md` files for episodes when you want static content
- Use `.Rmd` files for episodes when you need to generate output
- Run `sandpaper::check_lesson()` to identify any issues with your lesson
- Run `sandpaper::build_lesson()` to preview your lesson locally
