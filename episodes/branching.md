## Branches

Branches are key to working with version control as they allow the development of new features or fixing of bugs without
touching the current working version of code. New features and bug fixes are then merged into the `main` branch to
update the code base, but what is a branch?

The word suggests an analogy with trees where branches are parts of a tree the extend from the "main" trunk or recursively
from parent "branches". An intuitive model of this is shown in the figure below.

The `branch` has two commits on it and stems from the parent `main` at a point referred to as `base`. A branch is _not_
just the two commits that appear to exist on it (i.e. `3-8c52dce` and `5-2315fa0`) rather it is the full commit history
of that lineage including the commits in the "parent". That means the `branch` consists of the commits `0-472f101`,
`1-98f9a30` and `2-6769ff2` as well as `3-8c52dce` and `5-2315fa0`.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor

Take the time to make sure everyone understands what the graphic represents, explaining that each tag is a commit and
that the `branch` forks at a given point but doesn't have a commit associated with it.

The history of _both_ the `main` and the `branch` contain all points from the origin but

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

In a repository that is version controlled you will typically be checked out on the `HEAD` of a named branch. The `HEAD`
means the most recent commit in the history of that branch which on the `branch` is commit `5-2315fa0` whilst on `main`
the `HEAD` is `6-93e787c`.

You can change branches by using `git switch <branchname>`.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout

`git switch` was introduced in [Git
v2.23.0](https://github.blog/2019-08-16-highlights-from-git-2-23/#experimental-alternatives-for-git-checkout) along with
`git restore` to provide two separate commands for the functionality that was originally available in `git checkout`.
The main reason was to separate the functionality of `git checkout` which could "switch" branches, including creating
branches using the `--branch`/`-b` flag, and change ("restore") individual files with `git checkout [treeish] --
<filename>` (more on this later).

Splitting this functionality means that `git switch` is solely for `switch`ing branches whilst `git restore` is solely
concerned with `restore`ing files but is destructive and we will cover later the `git revert` command as an alternative.

`git checkout` has not been deprecated and is still available and many people still use it as old habits die hard.

```

This is a little more challenging to interpret but reading the output carefully we have an indicator of where the
`origin/main` branch is where it reads `(origin/main, main)`. All subsequent commits are on the currently checked out
branch which is `multiply` and `origin/multiply` (i.e. the local copy of the branch is at the same point as the remote
on GitHub).

Knowing this we can see that the `multiply` branch diverged from the `fa76751` commit on `main` and that three commits
have been made on the `multiply` branch.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Working with Branches

The `git switch` command is the common method for working with branches. It allows you to list, create and delete
branches along with a few other tasks.

To list the branches that are available you can just type `git branch` or optionally include the `--list` option. In the
`python-maths` repository you  have cloned you should see a number of branches listed. The branch you are currently
checked out on is listed first with an asterisk (`*` )at the start and they are listed alphabetically. Later we will
change the default order to be more informative.

``` bash
git branch

divide
main
* multiply
ns-rse/initial-setup
```

### Creating Branches

You can create a new branch using `git switch -c <new_branch>`. By default it will use the branch you currently have
checked out as a basis for the new branch. If you wish to use a different branch as a basis you can do so by including
its name before the name of the new branch.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout

Most of the time when creating branches you should do so from the `main` branch. It is therefore important to make sure
your local copy of the `main` branch is up-to-date. Before creating a branch you should checkout the `main` branch and
ensure it is up-to-date.

``` bash
git switch main
git pull
```

This means you can omit the explicit statement of which branch you wish to use as the basis for the new branch,
typically `main`, when creating it as you will be already be checked out on that branch when `git pull`.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

To create a new branch called `ns-rse/test` you can use the following.

``` bash
git switch main
git pull
git switch -c main ns-rse/test
```

Git will use the current `HEAD` of the `main` branch as a basis for creating the `ns-rse/test` branch.

### Naming Branches

Branch names can not include spaces, you should use underscores or dashes instead. You can include some special
characters too but I would avoid using `#` as this is the character used by most shells to indicate a comment and you
would therefore have to _always_ double quote the branch name at the command line.

A useful convention when creating branches is to include some meta data about who owns the branch and what it is for and
to construct the branch name from your GitHub/GitLab username followed by a `/` and because you will typically be
working on a particular issue include the issue number followed by a short few words which describe the work or
issue. For example GitHub user `ns-rse` working on issue 1 to fix typehints might create a branch called
`ns-rse/1-fix-typehints` from main.

This structure is informative as it provides other people you collaborate with or who look at the repository an
indication of who created the branch, what issue they are working on and a very short indication of what it is concerned
about. With this information it is very easy to look up the relevant Issue.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

## Challenge 3: Assign Issues, Create Branches and Complete the Tasks

In the `python-maths` repository you have cloned and setup on GitHub there are issue templates.

In your pairs assign the `01 Add zero division exception and test` to one person and the `02 Add a square root function
and test` to the other person.

Work through the tasks adding the necessary code, saving, staging and committing your changes then pushing to `origin`
(GitHub). **NB** only the first issue for zero division should have a Pull Request created, please do _not_ create a
pull request or merge the Square Root work.

Assign the person who worked on the Square root function to review the Zero Division exception and if everything looks
good merge the pull request.

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

## Solution - 01 Zero Division Exception

``` bash
git switch main
git switch -c main ns-rse/1-zero-divide-exception
# MAKE EDITS
git add -u
git commit -m "Add Zero division exception and test"
git push --set-upstream origin ns-rse/1-zero-divide-exception
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

## Solution - 02 Square root function

``` bash
git switch main
git pull
git switch -c ns-rse/2-square-root
# MAKE EDITS
git add -u
git commit -m "Adds square root function"
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Deleting branches

Branches are typically short lived as they are created to address small focused pieces of work such as fixing a bug or
implementing a new feature before being merged into the `main` branch. Over time you will accrue a number of redundant,
out-dated branches and it is therefore good practice to delete unwanted branches after they have been merged.

You can not delete a branch you currently have checked out so you must first checkout an alternative branch. Typically
this would be the `main` branch after your Pull Request has been merged and the changes you were working on have been
incorporated. You should `git pull` the `main` branch after merging changes so your locally copy is aware of any recent
merges from branches you are about to delete.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

## Challenge 4: Delete a branch

Create a throw away branch from `main` and then delete it (hint see `git branch --help`). You can create a branch with
your username and `throwaway` (e.g. `ns-rse/throwaway`) with the following.

``` bash
git checkout main
git pull
git switch -c ns-rse/throwaway
```

Pretending the branch you just created has been merged into the `main` branch via a Pull Request delete the now
redundant branch (in this example `ns-rse/throwaway`).

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

## Solution 1

You can use the `-d` or `--delete` flag to delete a branch.

``` bash
git switch main
git branch -d ns-rse/throwaway
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

## Solution 2

You can use the shortcut `git switch -` to switch to the last branch you were on (this is a shortcut that is common to
the Bash shell when navigating directories too, `cd -` will change directory to the previous directory you were in).

``` bash
git switch -
git branch -d ns-rse/throwaway
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout

You were able to delete the branch you created because you hadn't made any changes to it. If you have made changes on a
branch and they have not been merged into `main` then Git will warn you of this and refuse to delete the branch. This
can be over-ridden with the `--force` flag or the shorthand `-D` which is the same as `--delete --force`.

``` bash
git switch -c ns-rse/throwaway
touch test_file
git add test_file
git commit -m "Adding test_file"
git switch -
git branch -d ns-rse/throwaway
error: the branch 'ns-rse/throwaway' is not fully merged
hint: If you are sure you want to delete it, run 'git branch -D ns-rse/throwaway'
hint: Disable this message with "git config advice.forceDeleteBranch false"
git -D ns-rse/0-divide
```

Be _very_ careful when forcing deletions, if you have not pushed your changes to the remote `origin` then you _will_
lose them.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

## Challenge 5 : Automatically delete branches on GitHub

In your pairs navigate to the _Settings_ page and enable the _Automatically delete head branches_ option.

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

## Solution 1

This option is on the _General_ section of _Settings_ page, it indicates that "_Deleted branches will still be able to
be restored_".

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Time Travelling - Losing your `HEAD`

A branch is a history of commits and you can use `git log` to see the commit history (and customise the output so it can
be easier to read), but what if you wanted to look at the state of the branch at a previous point in time? Well because
Git has kept track of everything you can do that and the command to do so is the same one for switching branches
i.e. `git checkout` which takes a "reference" as an argument. So far you have been using branch names as references but
commit hashes are also references and so can be used to checkout the state of the repository in the past.

![A linear Git History on the `main` branch showing the position of `HEAD`.](https://mermaid.ink/img/pako:eNp1kT1rwzAQhv-KOTBerCDJ1oe1lSa0Q7duxYsiyYlobAdHgabG_71ygguFWpPuuecOjncE01sHCtJ09J0PKhmzcHSty1SS7fXFZXmSHXx4GfT5mM3doQ86uOe-bX1403t3ijQMVzfVXbK8-J_S9AGW4d-2uY8m3qqkBoxKQRuCSQ3_CwQxIgm3fE2giAteNQ1dEwokDaPWuDWhRNKZQlZ6TWCIFoQ1Gq8JHFWFE1KYNUGgvSmLav1MibTExjWyhiTow4xed0_bRYccWje02tsY1TizGu4x1TCrVg-fszpF73q2MZ-d9aEfQM3J5KCvoX-_dWapH87W68OgW1CNPl0iPevuo-__1KBG-AJFRblhFDMuZSk445TlcItYlhuBaYEJpixex6ccvu8b8EYyIbGsGClwbFA6_QAk7q7t?type=png){alt="A linear Git History on the `main` branch showing the position of `HEAD`."}

Here we have a simple linear history and the `HEAD` of branch is on commit `8-a80cef8` If you want to checkout commit
`4-8ec389a` then you would `git checkout 4-8ec389a` and you will see the following useful and informative warning
message.

``` bash
git checkout 4-8ec389a
Note: switching to 4-8ec389a'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

  git switch -c <new-branch-name>

Or undo this operation with:

  git switch -

Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false

HEAD is now at 4-8ec389a complete subtract issue template
```

Have you lost your head because it is now `detached`? No, `HEAD` is just a special reference that points to a specific
commit (tags are the same) and it is a short hand way of referring to a commit, what has happened is that Git has moved
the commit `HEAD` points to from `8-a40cef8` to `4-8ec389a`. If you make changes to this branch they will be lost when
you switch back to the `8-a40cef8` commit and you are told you can do this with `git switch -`. If you want to make
changes and save them you are advised to create a new branch to do so.

## Challenge 6: Checkout old commits

- Look at the history of the `python-maths` repository and find out who the author of commit `585287a` was.
- Checkout this commit and look at the contents of the file `tests/test_add.py` (you can use `cat tests/test_add.py`).
- Switch back to `HEAD` has anything changed in the `tests/test_add.py` file?

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

## Solution 1

``` bash
git checkout 585287a
cat tests/test_add.py

import src.python_calculator.add as add


def test_add():
    assert add.add(1, 3) == 4

git switch -
cat tests/test_add.py

cat: tests/test_add.py: No such file or directory
```

The file `tests/test_add.py` has an import statement and defines the `test_add()` function which checks if the
`add.add()` function returns the value of 4 when given the numbers 1 and 3.

The `tests/test_add.py` file no longer exists on the `HEAD` of the `main` branch!

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

## Solution 2

``` bash
git checkout 585287a
git diff main -- tests/test_add.py

diff --git a/tests/test_add.py b/tests/test_add.py
new file mode 100644

```

The file `tests/test_add.py` has an import statement and defines the `test_add()` function which checks if the
`add.add()` function returns the value of 4 when given the numbers 1 and 3.

The `tests/test_add.py` file no longer exists on the `HEAD` of the `main` branch!

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout

You are not restricted to switch to commits on the same branch you are currently on. You can checkout any commit in
the history as long as you know the commit hash.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Comparing References

This is quite a convoluted way of comparing branches though and in this instance the difference is quite simple the file
no longer exists, but imagine you wanted to compare a file between branches or commits _without_ having to switch
branches and try and hold in your head what the file looked like on one branch whilst you look at the other. That would
probably be very challenging.

Fortunately Git can help you here with `git diff`. This takes one or two arguments, which are commits or references that
you want to compare. If only one argument is given it compares the currently checked out commit to the supplied
commit/reference.

Thus to compare the `HEAD` of the `divide` branch you would

``` bash
git checkout ns-rse/1-zero-divide-exception
git diff 585287a
# Equivalent to...
git diff HEAD 585287a
```

## Ooops! I Did It Again

Nothing to do with Brittney Spears but you are at some stage likely to commit changes to the wrong branch. This can
easily happen when starting to work on an issue without first creating a new branch to contain the work and you commit
the changes to either the `main` branch, which is often protected so you won't be able to push your changes or the last
branch you were working on.

### `git reset`

One solution to solve this with Git is to `git reset` the branch to which you have just mistakenly made the commit. This
removes reference to the changes from the Git history but leaves the changes to the files in place and they appear as
`unstaged` files. It is ideal if you have only _one_ commit you wish to undo.

#### Relative Refs

Normally you are working on the `HEAD` of a branch which is the most recent commit that has been made along with any
staged, but uncommitted changes. Git has a simple way of referring to previous commits relative to `HEAD` using the `~`
and counting backwards.

If you want to undo the _last_ commit then you can do this using `git reset --soft HEAD~1`.

``` bash
touch test_file
git add test_file
git commit -m "Adding test_file"
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout

There are three options to `git reset` that influence how the changes in commits are handled these are `--soft`,
`--mixed` (the default) and `--hard`.

For a detailed exposition of `git reset` see the excellent [Atlassian | Git reset][atlassian_git_reset] article.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

## Challenge 7: Commits on the wrong branch

- Switch to the `main` branch of the `pytest-maths` repository.
- Create a new file using `echo "# How to Contribute to this repo" > CONTRIBUTING.md`
- Stage and commit the file to the `main` branch of your repository. **NB** to do this you will have to disable the
  `pre-commit` checks with the `-n` flag.

Ooops you've just committed to the `main` branch which is protected so you can't push your changes. Now move the commit
to a new branch so you can push them.

- Reset the change.
- Create a new branch called `<github_user>/contributing`.
- Stage and commit the file to `<github_user>/contributing`.

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

## Solution

You can `git reset --mixed` to `HEAD~1`, i.e. the previous commit, which removes the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file from the
commit history, leaving it unstaged, then create a new branch and add it to that.

``` bash
git switch main
echo "# How to Contribute to this repo" > CONTRIBUTING.md
git add CONTRIBUTING.md
git commit -n -m "docs: Adding contributing guideline template"
git reset --mixed HEAD~1
git switch -c ns-rse/contributing
git add CONTRIBUTING.md
git commit -m "docs: Adding contributing guideline template"
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

## Solution

Alternatively you can checkout the previous commit _before_ you added the file by mistake, create the
`<github_user>/contributing` branch,  and `git cherrypick` the commit from `main` which contains the `CONTRIBUTING.md`
file and _then_ remove the commit from main.

``` bash
git switch main
echo "# How to Contribute to this repo" > CONTRIBUTING.md
git add CONTRIBUTING.md
git commit -n -m "docs: Adding contributing guideline template"
git log              # Note the commit of the mistaken hash
git revert HEAD~1    # Checkout the previous commit on the main branch
git switch -c ns-rse/contributing
git cherrypick <hash>
git switch main
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

## Solution

A third similar option is checkout the previous commit _before_ you added the file by mistake, create the
`<github_user>/contributing` branch, and copy the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file from the `HEAD` of `main` using `git restore`
and _then_ remove the commit from main.

``` bash
# TODO get commit hash of last commit
git checkout HEAD~1
git switch -c ns-rse/contributing
git restore -s main -- CONTRIBUTING.md # Copy the file from HEAD of main branch or
git add CONTRIBUTING.md
git commit -m "Adding contributing guideline template"
git switch -   # Switch back to main
git
# TODO : Complete solution and add output once sample repository is in place
```

**NB** You could also copy the file using the older `git checkout main -- CONTRIBUTING.md`.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

You then have to decide how to add the changes to a branch. If they are brand new then you can create a new branch and
add them. If however they were meant to be added to an existing branch you face a slight problem as if you try to switch
branches you will be told that this would over-write the changes to the files you have just modified and unstaged and
you don't want to lose your work.

The solution here is to use `git stash` to temporarily store the unstaged changes, switch branches to the target branch
they should be on, and you can then un-stash them (known as `pop`ing) onto the correct branch.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout

You can set an alias to undo the last commit with

``` bash
git config --global alias.undo 'reset HEAD~'
```

This adds the following line to the `alias` section of your `~/.gitconfig`

``` bash
[alias]
    ...
    undo = reset HEAD~
```

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### `git revert`

`git reset` is destructive, you can lose work using it and it is advisable _not_ to use it when you have more than one
commit you wish to undo as you lose the intermediary work between commits as you are restored to the commit you reset
to. Fortunately Git has the `revert` option is a non-destructive approach to undoing changes in your Git
history. Instead it takes a specified commit and inverts the changes, i.e. goes back to the previous state and rather
than discarding the changes it makes a new "revert" commit to record the inversion and this new "revert" commit becomes
the `HEAD` of the branch. `git revert` _has_ to have a reference in order to work, whether that is absolute (i.e. a
hash) or relative.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout
The differences between `reset` and `revert` is that one (`reset`) is destructive and loses changes the other (`revert`)
undoes the changes and makes a new commit recording these changes.

Be _very_ careful when forcing deletions, if you have not pushed your changes to the remote `origin` then you will lose
them.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Switching Branches during Work in Progress

Sometimes you will be doing some work and a colleague will ask you to review a pull request or help them with a problem
they have on their branch. When performing pull request reviews it can be quite common to run tests to check everything
passes if you don't have Continuous Integration doing this automatically for you (we will come to that in another
episode).

But there is a challenge, in order to switch branches you have to stage and commit all changes to tracked files.

``` bash
git switch branch2
echo "Please feel free to contribute to this repository" >> CONTRIBUTING.md
git add CONTRIBUTING.md
git commit -m "Adding CONTRIBUTING.md"
echo "\nPlease don't break my repository though!" >> CONTRIBUTING.md
git switch main

error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:
 CONTRIBUTING.md
Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
Aborting
```

Whilst you could commit your changes and subsequently `git commit --amend` (more on this in the next episode) there is
another option.

### `git stash`

`git stash` allows you to save your current changes in a temporary location and then reverts to the last commit (`HEAD`)
and allows you to move about to other branches and undertake work. There are lots of options to `git stash` but the
basics are pretty straight-forward. You start by `git stash push` (the `push` is actually optional) and you can include
a `--message` that explains what the stash contains, you are told if this has worked and on what branch the stash was
made and can then switch branches, pull down changes, create a new branch and do something different.

#### 1. Stash `CONTRIBUTING.md`

``` bash
git stash --message "CONTRIBUTING.md WIP"
Saved working directory and index state On branch2: CONTRIBUTION.md WIP
```

#### 2. Switch to `main` and create `branch3`

``` bash
git switch main
# If this weren't a dummy example you might git pull
git switch -c branch3
```

Undertake the work that is required on `branch3`.

#### 3. Return to `branch2`

When you have finished this other work you can return to `branch2` and `pop` the stash back. To see what stashes there
are you can use `git stash list`

``` bash
git stash list
stash@{0}: On branch2: CONTRIBUTION.md WIP
```

#### 4. `pop` the last stash

When you are ready to restore the work you can do so using `git stash pop` which by default will restore the _last_
stash.

``` bash
git stash pop
On branch branch2
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
 modified:   CONTRIBUTING.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
Dropped refs/stash@{0} (13c8c6fb23f9fcdd884b4528356db37527c9b3e4)
```

The changes to `CONTRIBUTING.md` and the corresponding entry are removed from the stash list.

### Multiple Stashes

Over time though you may collect multiple stashes.

#### 1. Make two stashes

We stash `CONTRIBUTING.md`, the last message is reused by default, then we add `ANOTHER.md` and stash it with a
different message.

``` bash
git stash --message "CONTRIBUTING.md WIP"
echo "Yet another file" > ANOTHER.md
git add ANOTHER.md
git stash --message "Stashing ANOTHER.md file"

stash@{0}: On branch2: Stashing ANOTHER.md file
stash@{1}: WIP on branch2: a8b6f5f Adding CONTRIBUTING.md
```

#### 2. Pop the `CONTRIBUTING.md` stash

There are now two stashes each with different names.

You may not want to restore the work stashed with the commit message `Stashing ANOTHER.md file` but rather restore the
earlier `Adding CONTRIBUTING.md` work first. You can do this by referring to the number associated with the stash that
is within the curly braces. For the `Adding CONTRIBUTING.md` this is `1`.

``` bash
git stash pop 1

On branch branch2
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
 modified:   CONTRIBUTING.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
Dropped refs/stash@{1} (dd538beb8f14590f720e9b9f677ba7381240bd92)
```

Only the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file has been restored and not the `ANOTHER.md`.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

## Challenge 7: Stashing

Working in your pairs on the `python-maths` repository...

1. Create a `contributing` branch.
2. Create a `CONTRIBUTING.md` with `echo "# Contributing\n\nContributions to this repository are welcome via Pull
   Requests." > CONTRIBUTING.md`.
3. Do _not_ add and commit, instead `git stash` your changes.
4. Switch to the `main` branch and create a `citation` branch.
5. Add a basic `CITATION.cff` with `echo "cff-version: 1.2.0\ntitle: Pytest Examples\ntype: software" > CITATION.cff`.
6. Add and commit this file.
7. Unstash the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file on the `citation` branch.
8. Amend the previous commit to include `CONTRIBUTING.md` (**Hint** - you need to `add` and `commit` the file).
9. Push the changes to GitHub, create a merge request and merge the changes.
10. Delete the branches locally (try and avoid any messages telling you there are unmerged changes).

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

## Solution : stashing

Lets create the `contributing` branch

```bash
git switch -c contributing
echo "# Contributing\n\nContributions to this repository are welcome via Pull Requests." > CONTRIBUTING.md
```

If we want to switch branches without making a commit but save our work in progress we stash the work and switch to
`main` and create a new branch (`citation`) for and add a `CITATION.cff` file.

```bash
git stash -m "An example stash"
git switch main
git switch -c citation
echo "cff-version: 1.2.0\ntitle: Pytest Examples\ntype: software" > CITATION.cff
git add CITATION.cff
git commit -m "chore: Adding a CITATION.cff"
```

We now unstash the contributing work to this branch and commit the changes, amending the commit and push to GitHub

```bash
git pop
git add CONTRIBUTING.md
git commit -m --amend "chore: Adding a CITATION.cff and CONTRIBUTING.md"
git push
```

You should then create a Pull Request and merge it. To ensure don't get any messages about unmerged changes when
deleting the branches you should pull the changes that have been merged to `main`.

``` bash
git switch main
git pull
git branch -d {citation, contributing}
```

## Popping around and applying

- You can `git stash apply` to `pop` a stash but leave it in the stash list.

There are a lot of useful things `git stash` can be used for. Refer to the help pages (`git stash --help`) for more
information as well as the Further Resources.

## References - a revelation

Whilst we have focused on consolidating our understanding of branches in this introductory episode there have been hints
as to the _true_ nature of branches in Git, have you worked out what this is yet?

Internally Git does not have branches at all! Branches are merely a reference to a series of commits and each commit in
a "branch" references the commit prior to it. In fact everything in Git that allows us to look at the
different states of the repository and move between them is a reference, whether that is a named branch, or a tag which
is a relative reference. They all point to a commit.

This was a revelation that came to me as I wrote the material for this Episode and thought it worth sharing.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- Branches and how they relate to each other are fundamental to collaborating using Git.
- The history of a branch is a series of commits and extends all the way back to the very first commit and _not_ the
  point at which it forked from its parents.
- Branches can be easily created, merged and deleted.
- Commits all have references and Git can move you between these references using `git commit` or compare them using
  `git diff`.
